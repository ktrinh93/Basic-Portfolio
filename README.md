# Basic-Portfolio

Bare bones portfolio using HTML and CSS which consists of three (3) pages:
1) About me: an image of me alongside a short biography
2) Portfolio: currently placeholders for future projects. ideally, clicking on a project would lead to a new page that went into more details about said project, may include images/diagrams/links to other created websites
3) Contact: a currently dummy contact form, simple text inputs
